# This script is used to create Unknown Horizons release tarballs for linux
# It will copy all needed fife files to a 'fife' folder in the Unknown Horizons folder
#
# Please note, in order for a successful run of this script we assume you are in a directory
# that has two childern fife/ and unknown-horizons/ that you will specifiy. The fife/ folder
# containing the the FIFE svn trunk and the unknown-horizons/ folder containing the
# Unknown Horizons folder. So you would find: fife/test_fife.py and unknown-horizons/run_uh.py
